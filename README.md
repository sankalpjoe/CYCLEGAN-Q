## Overview
This project implements a novel approach to image-to-image translation using Quantum-enhanced CycleGAN. The framework combines classical convolutional neural networks with quantum circuit layers to explore potential advantages in image generation tasks, specifically for day-to-night and night-to-day image conversion.

CycleGAN is a powerful image-to-image translation model that can learn to transform images from one domain to another without paired training examples. This quantum-enhanced version extends the classical CycleGAN by incorporating quantum computing elements through Qiskit, providing a novel approach to generative adversarial networks.


## Key Features
- Quantum-enhanced convolutional layers integrated with PyTorch
- Hybrid classical-quantum architecture for image-to-image translation
- Benchmarking framework comparing quantum vs. classical approaches
- Visualization tools for quantum circuit states and operations
- Adaptive quantum contribution with learnable blending parameters
- Memory-efficient implementation for handling quantum operations

  │   ├── days/
  │   └── nights/
  └── val/
      ├── days/
      └── nights/
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory Usage**: Quantum simulation requires significant memory; the implementation uses strategies like downsampling and selective quantum layer application
- **Training Time**: Training with quantum components is computationally intensive; a full training run may take significantly longer than classical CycleGAN
- **Batch Size**: The default batch size is reduced to accommodate quantum operations
- **GPU Memory Management**: The code implements specific optimizations to handle GPU memory constraints

## Results

The project demonstrates several interesting findings:

1. **Quality Improvements**: The quantum-enhanced model achieves slightly better PSNR and SSIM scores compared to the classical model, indicating potential benefits for image quality.

2. **Performance Trade-off**: The quantum model has approximately 30% longer inference time compared to the classical approach.

3. **Adaptive Quantum Contribution**: The model learns to adjust the contribution of quantum processing, with higher contributions in early layers and lower in later layers.

4. **Resource Efficiency**: The hybrid approach effectively balances the computational demands of quantum processing with classical neural networks.

5. **Image Detail Preservation**: Experimental results suggest improved preservation of fine details in some cases.

6. **Color Distribution**: The quantum approach potentially generates more diverse color transformations compared to classical methods.
